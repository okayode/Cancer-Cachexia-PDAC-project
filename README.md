# Machine Learning-Based Identification of Blood Biomarkers that Distinguish Precachectic and Cachectic Patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma


Cancer-associated cachexia (CC) is a multifactorial syndrome observed in up to 80% of PDAC patients, characterized by unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting in the presence or absence of fat loss, and fatigue [1], which can lead to a reduction in quality of life and poor clinical outcomes. [2, 3].

To distinguish between cachexia stages, we followed the Florida Pancreas Collaborative and used criteria described in [4], which are based on the Vigano classification [5]. This classification system is comprised of the following types of data: (a) biochemistry (level of C-reactive protein (CRP) or albumin, or hemoglobin, or white blood cell count), (b) changes in food intake, (c) minimal or significant weight loss (WL), and (d) changes in daily activities based on the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) performance status [6]. The  recognized 4 cancer cachexia stages are: noncachexia (NCa), precachexia (PCa)—an early stage of the syndrome characterized by abnormal food intake or blood chemistry but no significant weight loss, cachexia (Ca), and refractory cachexia (RCa)—a stage that is largely irreversible [7].

We provide three tools to distinguish between NCa and Ca stages, PCa vs. Ca stages, and PCa vs. NCa stages.
## These classifiers need the following libraries

```bash
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
pandas
tensorflow
statsmodels
scipy
```
